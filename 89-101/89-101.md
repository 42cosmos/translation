## Conversion

### Interface Conversions

Mover provides support for moving things.

```go
type Mover interface {
  Move()
}
```

Locker provides support for locking and unlocking things.

```go
type Locker interface {
  Lock()
  Unlock()
}
```

MoveLocker provides support for moving and locking things.

```go
type MoveLocker interface {
  Mover
  Locker
}
```

bike represents a concrete type for the example.

```go
type bike struct {}
```

Move can change the position of a bike.

```go
func (bike) Move () {
  fmt.Println( "Moving the bike" )
}
```

Lock prevents a bike from moving.

```go
func (bike) Lock () {
  fmt.Println( "Locking the bike" )
}
```

Unlock allows a bike to be moved.

```go
func (bike) Unlock () {
  fmt.Println( "Unlocking the bike" )
}

func main () {
```

Declare variables of the MoveLocker and Mover interfaces set to their zero value.

```go
  var ml MoveLocker
  var m Mover
```

Create a value of type bike and assign the value to the MoveLocker interface value.

```go
  ml = bike{}
```

An interface value of type MoveLocker can be implicitly converted into
a value of type Mover. They both declare a method named move.

```go
  m = ml
```

However, we cannot go in the other direction, like so:

```go
  ml = m
```

The compiler will say:
`cannot use m (type Mover) as type MoveLocker in assignment: Mover does not implement MoveLocker (missing Lock method).`
